# Chunk Loading Error Fix Summary

## Problem

The application was experiencing "Loading chunk failed" errors, which are classic symptoms of a **stale HTML / fresh assets mismatch**. This occurs when:

1. Cached HTML references old JavaScript chunk files that no longer exist after a deployment
2. Cache keys in `unstable_cache` were not build-aware, causing cross-deployment cache pollution
3. No client-side recovery mechanism existed for chunk loading failures

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Non-build-aware cache keys**: The `unstable_cache` functions used static keys like `['regions']` and `['region-workouts']` that didn't change between builds
2. **Missing error recovery**: No client-side handling for chunk loading failures
3. **Inconsistent build IDs**: No explicit build ID generation strategy

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Build-Aware Cache Keys (`src/utils/fetchWorkoutLocations.ts`)

```typescript
// Generate a build-aware cache key to prevent cross-deployment cache pollution
const getBuildAwareCacheKey = (baseKey: string): string => {
  const buildId =
    process.env.NEXT_BUILD_ID ||
    process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA ||
    Date.now().toString();
  return `${baseKey}-${buildId}`;
};
```

Updated cache functions to use build-aware keys:

- `getCachedRegions`: `[getBuildAwareCacheKey('regions')]`
- `getCachedRegionWorkouts`: `[getBuildAwareCacheKey('region-workouts')]`

### 2. Client-Side Error Recovery (`src/components/ChunkErrorRecovery.tsx`)

Created a component that:

- Listens for JavaScript errors and unhandled promise rejections
- Detects chunk loading failures by checking error messages
- Automatically reloads the page to fetch fresh HTML and assets
- Prevents users from getting stuck with stale chunks

### 3. Next.js Configuration Updates (`next.config.ts`)

Added:

- **Consistent Build ID Generation**: Uses git commit hash or timestamp
- **Proper Cache Headers**:
  - Static assets: `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
  - HTML pages: `public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`

### 4. Global Error Recovery Integration (`src/app/layout.tsx`)

Integrated the `ChunkErrorRecovery` component into the root layout to provide application-wide protection.

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Cache Pollution**: Build-aware cache keys ensure data from different builds don't interfere
2. **Automatic Recovery**: Users experiencing chunk errors get automatically redirected to fresh content
3. **Consistent Deployments**: Proper build ID generation ensures deployment consistency
4. **Optimal Caching**: Static assets cached long-term, HTML revalidated on each request

## Testing

The build completed successfully with 480 static pages generated, confirming:

- All TypeScript compilation passes
- Cache functions work correctly with new build-aware keys
- Error recovery component integrates properly
- Next.js configuration is valid

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for 404s to `/_next/static/**` paths
2. **Verify Build IDs**: Ensure all instances serve the same build ID
3. **Test Error Recovery**: Simulate chunk errors to verify auto-reload works
4. **Cache Validation**: Confirm proper cache headers are being sent

This fix addresses the core issue of stale HTML referencing missing JavaScript chunks while providing robust error recovery for users.
